Hello OM,
I had phone call from Wakitasan,JE8PEL about my old C-source code of
TrakBOx.
It has flown many time after the last TrakBox EPROM release.
My TrakBOx development system was missing due to old PC failure.
After searching the PC from my junk box, finally ang fortunately, I found
The broken PC and extract IDE hard disk.
Here I enclosed the C-source code for 8052, 80C320, 80C251 CPU
If you need the DEFINE, INCLUDE files for compiling I will forward you
The total system files of compiler set.

The enclosed ZIP file has
W3IWI's original tracking BASIC code which I implemented for C
The latest source code  ETC.

I hope the code is helpful for your project.
BTW, what is the CPU you intend to implement?
