2-2 Connection with rotator controller

　The AZ / EL dual rotator controller currently on the market is a computer
    Since it has a terminal for the interface, is it "VersaBoard-8052"?
    Can be connected directly to the controller.
  　To accommodate controllers that do not have such an interface, "Ve
    "rsaBoard-8052" is an open collector Darlington connection transistor
    Array IC is available. This can be controlled up to 50V, 500mA, but this
    With this, the rotator motor cannot be turned on / off directly, so relays and trials
    It is necessary to make an external interface using KU. For details, each row
    Please also read the instruction manual of the data controller.

The basic wiring between "VersaBorder-8052" and the rotator is as follows.

2-3 Additional hardware when grouping as a stand-alone TrackBOX

　When controlling TrakBox with the computer as the terminal mode, the above ante
  Only the narrow datar interface is fine, but it works in standalone mode
  The following work is required when putting together to make.


2-3-1 Satellite selection SW
　
　1) When using rotary binary SW

　8255 port B is used in input mode and bits 0 to 3 are used as rotary binary SW.
     Connect 0-F (16 positions) or 1-10 (10 positions BCD)
     You can also use the shift. Binary encoder SW has each terminal at position 0
     You need an open type (a real type, not a complementary type).
     Insert the 8255 port B pull-up resistor (RP3 47kx8).


   CN9 (8255 port-B) Binary SW (real logic)
     1 bit0 ----------- bit0 ^^^^^^^^^^
     2 bit1 ----------- bit1
     3 bit2 ----------- bit2
     4 bit3 ----------- bit3
     GND ----------- comon terminal


　2) When using a volume (variable resistor)

　It is also possible to select an analog satellite in VR without using a digital SW as the satellite selection SW.
   I can do it. In that case, connect as follows.

  CN9 (8255 port-B)
    PB5 pin6 －－－－－－－－ GND

  By dropping pin 6 to GND, satellite selection is AD converter from 8255 port B.
   Switch to voltage to. The voltage between Vcc and GND is divided by VR, and the voltage is divided.
   The pressure is read by the AD converter and the satellite is switched.

　VR is suitable for about 10k to 50k ohms. The state of turning all the way to the left is the digital SW
    At 0, it is in the terminal mode, and when it is turned all the way to the right, the satellite No. 15 is selected
     It corresponds to the voice.

　3) When using a rotary switch and a resistor

　Alternatively, assemble as follows with a 16-contact rotary SW and 16 1k ohm resistors.
    You can also. Also in this case, connect CN-9 pin 6 to the ground.

   Vcc---1k-1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k--1k- --- GND

　　When approaching AOS, it blinks at EL> -3.0 and antenna control S at EL> 2.0.
        When W is ON, it will be in a continuous lighting state.



2-3-4 Antenna control SW connection


   CN9 (8255 port-B)
     5 bit4 ------- SW ------- GND

　When this SW is ON in standalone mode, "TracBox" turns the rotator.
     Control While controlling the rotator, track in front of the satellite name on the LCD display
     Ng mark (*,!, &) Is attached.

2-4 Connection with wireless device

　1) Frequency control compatible models
　"TrakBox" is for the rigs of YAESU, KENWOOD, and ICOM.
     Frequency control is possible. This sends a command from an external computer to the frequency of the rig
     Use the remote function that can control the number and mode. This feature
     It is called CAT system in YAESU and CI-V in ICOM.

                                    ―― 7 ――
　
　　 The supported rigs are shown in Table 2-4. However, for YAESU and ICOM rigs
     In order to connect, the modification described later in "VersaBoard-8052" in advance
     You have to carry out the construction.

　3) Connection method to YAESU / ICOM rig

　　　First, the following modifications are required. This is KENWOO on the YAESU / ICOM rig
            This is because the logic of the D rig and the signal are opposite, and it does not have to be inverted.

　　  The output of pin 2 is inverted again by the inverter, and the surplus pin 3 of CN4
          Take it out. The modified part is shown in the figure below.








　　　　　                     Pattern surface diagram

















　If the above modification is performed, pin 3 will become a terminal for YAESU / ICOM.
　　 　　 CN4

　Also, when using the manufacturer's original RS232C interface, the above KE
    Connect to CN4 pin 1 like NWOOD.

　4) Connection for frequency tracking using microphone click

　Even with rigs that do not have a remote function, the frequency can be increased to the microphone or accessory connector.
      If the rig has a terminal that can control Down, frequency control is possible by clicking the microphone.
       Noh.

 (*) In the YAESU receiver, the polarity of the pulse is reversed, so pull up to the outside.
　　    Try changing the polarity with the menu 6-8 microphone click setting.
　       when.

  　　The input voltage to the ADC is divided by a resistor so that it becomes 2.5V ± (0.3 to 0.5V).
　　　If it is insufficient, amplify it with an operational amplifier and supply it.

　About automatic tracking by microphone click

　When receiving PSK such as AO-16, Doppler correction with an accuracy of about + -50Hz is required.
　However, it is extremely difficult to achieve this value using the CAT method.
　TrackBox's microphone click Doppler correction is a closed loop by analog AFC method.
　The feedback method is adopted. Modem PLL or FM demodulator
　The reference voltage of is read by the ADC of TrakBox, and A at the time of locking or tuning.

                                 --40 -

　A frequency up or down pulse is generated to bring it closer to the DC value.
　In order to perform automatic operation, the receiver must be tuned to the frequency at the time of AOS in advance.
　Must be. TrakBox achieves this by the method described below.

        Enter Step frequency [Hz]: 100 <-1
        Frequency set CAT command at AOS? [Y / N] y <-2
        Automatic up pulse generation at AOS? [Y / N] y <-3
        Porlarity of step pulse, Normal / Reverse? [N / R] n <-4

　In the configuration menu 8, the frequency step (1: 100Hz above) is indicated.
　It is set and the automatic up pulse generation option (3 above) is set to Y.
　And TrackBox execute the frequency setting at the time of AOS by the following method.

　The frequency at the time of the previous LOS is recorded in the memory, and the difference in frequency is taken up at the next AOS.
　Calculate the number of pulses.
　
　(Example) F1: Fundamental frequency F_AOS: Calculated frequency at AOS
　　　　　F_LOS: Frequency of the previous orbit during LOS
　　　　　F_step: Frequency step

　(1) When a satellite is selected, F1 of satellite information is stored in memory. (Receiver
　　　　　Set the dial to this frequency as well.) When the satellite is AOS, at this point
　　　　　The difference from the frequency (F_AOS) after Doppler correction is the step value (S_st).
　　　　　The number divided by ep) is the number of uppulses. When the elevation angle reaches -2 degrees, a pulse is emitted.
　　　　　It is output to the port.
　(2) After AOS, use analog AFC of modem or AFC of TrackBox to LOS.
　　　　　Frequency tracking is performed up to.
　(3) The frequency (F_LOS) at the time of LOS is stored in memory and waits for the next AOS.
　(4) At the next AOS, the frequency is set to A by (F_AOS-F_LOS) ÷ F_step.
　　　　　A pulse that pulls back to the value at the time of OS is sent.
　　　　　At this time, the progress is displayed on the display as follows.

   　fdx / f_diff / pulse: 435.120000/9772/97
   　UP pulse: * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * _ * ............

　　In this example, F1 = 435.120MHz, step 100Hz, 97 pulses
　　Has been generated.

2-8 Summary

　With this version, we have taken in the requests from beta testers from each country.
    I was able to follow many of the functions that I can think of at the moment. Especially, "TracBox"
     By using, the computer can concentrate on the original data communication and file management.
     Program with the control of antennas and transceivers left to a dedicated "box"
     We have been developing. This small "magic box" is for many satellite communication people.
     I think it has become an indispensable accessory for Mulife.
　 Dedicate this box to more antenna and transceiver control so that it can be used for more purposes
     For the purpose of reminding you, we have added the function of host mode. For example, on the computer side
     Then, the current orbit information and frequency are sequentially sent to "TracBox", and the CRT is more vibrant.
     Aspects such as combining with applications and communication software that focus on dual information
     A white attempt is awaited.
　 In the future, we will not officially release the ROM form or manual version upgrade.
     We will make it possible to obtain images such as ROM through the computer and JDB. Get it yourself
     Please upgrade the version.
      If you have any questions about TrackBox, please send them to JDB or the following in writing. as much as possible
      We will answer, but please allow 3 to 5 weeks.
      In the case of writing, please use a round-trip postcard.
